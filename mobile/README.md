# RootLens Capture App

An iPhone app (React Native + Expo, with native Swift modules) that records
egocentric video of real work and uploads the raw recording sessions that
become robot-learning training data. Settings expose two capture methods:

- **iPhone ARKit** records RGB + ARKit/LiDAR/VIO sensor outputs on this phone.
- **iPhone** records ultra-wide RGB + microphone audio + raw accelerometer and
  gyroscope samples on this phone, without starting ARKit.

The recording rig is an iPhone Pro mounted on the worker's head. Recording is
hands-free: the operator can choose gestures, spoken commands, or iOS physical
volume buttons as parallel start/stop control flows, so the screen is not needed
while working.

## What an iPhone ARKit recording produces

Each recording session is a directory of files on a shared clock. Every sensor
timestamp is nanoseconds on the same monotonic time base, so streams align
without post-hoc synchronization.

| File | Content |
|---|---|
| `rgb.mp4` | H.264 video from the rear wide camera, full-sensor 4:3 (1920x1440), fragmented MP4 so a crash loses at most the last 10 seconds |
| `frames.jsonl` | One row per video frame: camera pose (4x4, ARKit world frame), intrinsics, tracking state, an IMU snapshot, and realtime hand landmarks. Row `i` corresponds to mp4 frame `i`; a row is written only after its frame lands in the mp4, so the pairing holds by construction |
| `imu.jsonl` | Accelerometer, gyroscope, and device motion at the configured rate (100 Hz default) |
| `metadata.json` | Delivered-file manifest, schema version, device/OS/app, camera sensor rate, requested/effective output rates, encoding/timebase, intrinsics, measured stream counts/ranges, thermal events, and battery drain |
| `depth.tar` | LiDAR depth, one 16-bit PNG (millimeters) per frame under `depth/`, with the matching ARKit confidence map (8-bit, low/medium/high) under `confidence/`. LiDAR devices only |
| `pointcloud.jsonl` | ARKit VIO feature points per frame, world coordinates, raw float32 bytes |
| `mesh.jsonl` | ARKit scene-reconstruction mesh anchors, raw vertex and face buffers |
| `arkit_imu.jsonl` | One row per ARFrame (full sensor rate, sampling-independent): VIO camera orientation quaternion, angular velocity from the quaternion delta between consecutive frames, tracking state and reason |
| `device_metrics.jsonl` | One row per ARFrame: battery level/state, thermal state, per-thread CPU usage, resident memory footprint, grantable memory. Values refresh every 500 ms under each frame's own timestamp |

`metadata.json` additionally gains, at stop: per-stream counts and time ranges,
expected sampler slots, append failures, tracking-pause accounting, the
camera-IMU extrinsic estimate (hand-eye solve over the session's first
well-excited window, cached per device model), and a labeled static IMU noise
model (`source: "static_defaults"`).

Older clips name the per-frame track `realtime_handpose.jsonl`; the schema is
identical. Clips recorded before the per-ARFrame streams existed simply lack
those two files; the delivery pipeline degrades their topics to empty channels.

### Data fidelity

The data is used for research, so the app applies as little processing as
possible. The complete list of transforms between sensor and file:

- Video is H.264-encoded (inherently lossy). Rotation is stored as an MP4
  metadata flag; pixels are never resampled.
- Depth is quantized from float32 meters to uint16 millimeters. NaN becomes 0,
  the conventional RGB-D sentinel for missing data. The PNG container is
  lossless.
- The IMU `accel` field is the sum of user acceleration and gravity; both raw
  components are also stored under `device_motion`, so nothing is lost.

Everything else, including poses, intrinsics, confidence maps, feature points,
and mesh geometry, is written verbatim.

## iPhone RGB + IMU contract

The non-ARKit **iPhone** method uses a four-file delivered manifest:

| File | Content |
|---|---|
| `rgb.mp4` | Rear ultra-wide H.264, 1920x1080 at 30 fps, with mono AAC microphone audio at 48 kHz |
| `frames.jsonl` | One row per appended MP4 video sample, including the raw capture timestamp, canonical/input-port mapping, host-clock diagnostic, MP4 PTS, residual video-to-IMU offset, and neighboring accelerometer/gyroscope indices and timestamps |
| `imu.jsonl` | Raw accelerometer (m/s²) and gyroscope (rad/s) samples with their unmodified Core Motion timestamps |
| `metadata.json` | Capture settings, measured stream counts/failures, camera facts, timestamp sources, calibration audit fields, and the exact four-file delivered manifest |

`CMSampleBuffer.presentationTimeStamp` is expressed on
`AVCaptureSession.synchronizationClock`, while Core Motion timestamps are
boot-relative. Following Apple's documented Core Motion synchronization example,
every video timestamp is reverse-mapped to `AVCaptureInput.Port.clock` with
`CMSyncConvertTime`, which accounts for the clocks' offset and measured drift.
The same source timestamp is also mapped to `CMClockGetHostTimeClock()` and
retained as an independent diagnostic.
`frames.jsonl` keeps the unmodified capture timestamp in `timestamp_ns` and
`camera_sensor_timestamp_ns`, the canonical mapping in
`video_frame_timestamp_canonical_ns` and `camera_timestamp_mapped_input_port_clock_ns`,
and the host diagnostic in `camera_timestamp_mapped_system_uptime_ns`.
Frame-to-IMU association uses only the canonical mapping. Clock rates, anchor
pairs, and each mapping's difference from `ProcessInfo.systemUptime` at recording start
are copied into metadata so a delivered clip can be audited without inferring
the mapping from image motion.

The remaining observable end-to-end sensor/pipeline residual can be measured
from a five-minute Settings recording made through the exact same session and
recorder as production capture. Only a repeatable result is persisted. The
stored residual is reused on that device until remeasurement and is used only
for frame-to-IMU association; raw video and IMU timestamps are never rewritten.
The calibration record is stored per device model and ultra-wide camera, and is
copied into each clip's metadata for auditability. Before upload, the server
issues a `unit_id` from the anonymous site code and recording start time. The
app writes it to metadata, hashes every source file, and fixes the resulting
`source_manifest_sha256` before requesting upload URLs.

A clip's identity is its server-issued `unit_id`, which is also the R2 prefix
and database primary key. Identity is independent of file bytes. Integrity is
checked per source file and across the canonical source manifest. Delivery
files receive a separate delivery manifest after processing.

For iPhone captures, the wearer reviews each local clip and records consent
before upload. The upload is stage-resumable (manifest, upload, register), so a
failed or interrupted upload retries without redoing finished work. Mentra uses
the independent field-device path described in `glasses/README.md`.

## Development

Use Node.js 22 and Xcode with an iOS 16.4 or newer deployment target.

```bash
npm install
cd ios && LANG=en_US.UTF-8 pod install && cd ..
npx expo run:ios --device        # native modules require a real device
```

Production builds ship through EAS (`eas build --platform ios --profile
production`). Environment template: `.env.example`.
