## Do not upload

- `/Users/forest/Downloads/RootLens-Claru-RF-Source`
  - Working copies of long source recordings. Never upload these as delivery.
  - Delete a working copy only after its Drive delivery is confirmed and the user explicitly approves deletion.
- `tools/session_cutter/boundaries/`
  - Internal boundary checkpoints required to reproduce exports.
- `tmp/claru-clock-audits/`
  - Internal clock-model audit inputs required to reproduce exports.
- `document/v0.1.4/tasks/18-claru-session-cutter/validation/`
  - Internal validation reports.

## Storage rule

After a Drive upload is verified, delete its superseded exports first. Delete the
corresponding long source only after the uploaded delivery is confirmed readable.
Never delete boundary checkpoints, clock audits, or validation reports; their
combined size is negligible and they are required for reproducibility.
