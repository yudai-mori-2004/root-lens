# RootLens Trustless Verification Module

This module performs content verification entirely client-side.
It connects ONLY to:

- **Solana RPC** — for on-chain cNFT data (GlobalConfig, collection membership)
- **Arweave** — for off-chain metadata (signed_json with TEE signatures)
- **WASM binary source** — for pHash computation (same binary as TEE, hash-verified)

It does **NOT** connect to any RootLens server endpoint.
All verification can be independently reproduced by anyone
with access to the `content_hash` and a Solana RPC endpoint.

## Trust Model

- **General users**: Trust the RootLens brand (practical basis)
- **Skeptics**: Open DevTools → All Solana RPC and Arweave requests are visible in the Network tab. No RootLens server calls appear for verification data.

See SPECS_JA.md §7.4.4 for the DevTools verification traceability specification.
